## Why execute relation formalization?
Till now, we are able to extract relation that humans can easily understand but except for machines. To bridge the gap so that machine and comprehend, we design and leverage some predicate transformation mechanism to generate the desired FOL expression **(called guard)**. Below customized representation patterns are used in guards.

Below table shows the accuracy of our generated guards for three ARINC653 versions (P1-3 to P1-5), result indicates our approach is available to translate almost (over 97%) all SVOs into guards.
